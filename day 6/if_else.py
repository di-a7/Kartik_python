# you can use nested if-else or other logic to determine the winner

# user 1 = r, user2 = p:--->user2 wine
# user 1 = r, user2 = s:--->user1 wine

# user 1 = p, user2 = r:--->user1 wine
# user 1 = p, user2 = s:--->user2 wine

# user 1 = r, user2 = p:--->user2 wine
# user 1 = r, user2 = s:--->user1 wine

# user1 and user 2 input same--> Tie

# r,p ---> p wins
