# for loop

# iterable: sequential data type list, tuple, string, dictionary, set
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,8,4,"aisdjf"]
# iteration: repeating a block of code for multiple times, proceess of iteration over a sequence
# iterator: a variable used to iterate over a sequence


# for iterator in iterable:
   #  print(statements)

for i in range(5,50):
   print("Hello",i)

# list of hobbies

# implement for loop to print each hobbies

# todo:
# create a dictionary with names and age 
user = {"ram":25,"shyam":30,"hari":22}
# get names from user
# check if name exist in the dictionary, if exist print the age of the person, else print user not found
print(user["ram"])
# print the oldest person from dictionary(optional)


# create a dictioanry with username and password
# get username and password from user
# check if username exist in the dictionary and check if the password match, if match print "login successful", else print "invalid password"

# assignment using for loop
# get a number from user and print the multiplication table of the number using for loop
