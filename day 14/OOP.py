# OOP: Object Oriented Programming

# class : blueprint, stucture
# objects : real world entity, data created using class
# the variables defined inside the class are called attributes
# a class can have multiple objects
# the variable where the class are called, object
# class Car:
#    brand = "Toyota"  # brand, color, seats are attributes
#    color = "White"
#    seats = "5"

# c1 = Car()        # c1 is the object
# print(c1.brand)
# print(c1.color)
# print(c1.seats)

# c2 = Car()
# c2.brand = "ANC"
# c2.speed = "200/hr"
# print(c2.brand)
# print(c2.color)
# print(c2.seats)
# print(c2.speed)

# c3 = Car()
# print(c3.brand)
# print(c3.color)
# print(c3.seats)
# # print(c3.speed)

# print(Car)

# print(type("abc"))

# function defined inside a class is termed method
# Constructor: method that are called during objects creation
